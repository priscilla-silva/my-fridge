My Fridge

"My Fridge" is an app that allows you to share food, spices, and even leftovers among your contacts. The purpose is to alleviate the great problem that food waste represents.

*--FUNCTIONALITY--*

-> Ideally, one would be able to search and "look" into your contacts' fridges and they'd be able to search yours. If one of you spots an item that you might want, you would just request it.

-> The number on the bar represents how many requests the item alreadt has

*--FEATURES I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO IMPLEMENT--*

-> A reserve system for the items

-> A database to upload *actual* food pictures

-> More user profiles


*--CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED--*

-> React is too damn hard

-> Time constraints. I should've started this earlier

-> Team work. I really believed I would have benefited from working in a team so I wouldn't have to worry about building the whole thing myself. I couldn't do it due to me not being in Sweden for the majority of the JS section


*--WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO FURTHER LEARN/IMPROVE--*

-> A better understanding of React hookx, especially useEffect, which I'm still not quite sure I understand what it does exactly

-> More tricks in vanilla JS, though fewer and fewer applications use it these days
